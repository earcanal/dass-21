# DASS-21

This is the [21 item Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)](https://earcanal.github.io/dass-21/) for use in the [Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory). It was generated from the [tab separated file of questions](survey.tsv) and a [configuration file](config.json) using [this procedure](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/contribute#contribute-a-survey). 

You can run it locally by putting these files in a web server, or use the Experiment Factory to generate a reproducible container. Check out the documentation above for more information, or [post an issue](https://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory/issues) if you have any questions.

# Processing Data in R

There's an associated **alpha** `R` package for processing the data generated by the DASS-21. This will happen in continuous integration, and you can run manually like this:

```
bash
cd expfactory.dass21
R -e 'devtools::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)'
R -e 'devtools::check()'
R -e 'devtools::test()'
```

## Installation

```
library(devtools)
install_github('earcanal/dass-21/expfactory.dass21')
```
